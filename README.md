# Project Name: Map Visualization App

## Description
This app provides a dynamic web interface for visualizing geographic data layers on a map. Utilizing OpenLayers for robust map handling capabilities, users can upload various geospatial data formats (like GeoJSON, KML, and Shapefiles), select different base maps, and manipulate data layers visually on the map.

## Features
- **Dynamic Base Map Switching**: Toggle between multiple base map styles provided by MapTiler.
- **Data Upload**: Users can upload and visualize geographic data in multiple formats including Shapefiles, GeoJSON, and KML.
- **Layer Control**: Manage different layers on the map; users can add, remove, or modify the appearance of these layers.
- **Responsive Design**: Fully responsive web design ensures that the app is accessible on both desktop and mobile devices.

## Technologies Used
- **React**: Frontend library for building the user interface.
- **Next.js**: React framework for server-side rendering and generating static websites.
- **OpenLayers**: An open-source JavaScript library for displaying map data in web browsers.
- **MapTiler**: Provides various styles of base maps.
